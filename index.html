        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I was born in Indiana. My parents divorced when I was two so I moved to California. I lived there until I was 10 and then do to another unfortunate circumstance relocated again for the better. I have lived in Tucson, Arizona ever since. </p>

        <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>I currently work for MiTek HBS Sales Simplicity as a Software Trainer. I have done a variety of tasks including covering for Support and Level 2 Support. I already have HTML, Ruby, C++, and SQL language knowledge and I see that having more skills
            will be useful for my company as well as my goal to be a developer. I have decided to become a developer to be more versatile for both my company and my career. </p>
